      FUN FACT: Croissants are acually from Austria (Vienna). They belong to the
      Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked goods along with brioche, Danish
      and puff pastries. Croissants are often stuffed with different sweet or
      savory fillings. The classic sweet-filled croissants use almonds,
      marzipan, or chocolate, whereas savory croissants might be filled
      variously with cheese, spinach, or ham.
