    <p>
      Croissants are French viennoiserie pastries that are actually from Austria
      (Vienna). They are made with a yeast leavened dough that has been
      laminated with butter, in multiple layers. A croissant is a laminated,
      yeast-leavened bakery product that contains dough/roll-in fat layers to
      create a flaky, crispy texture. Croissants belong to the Viennoiserie or
      pastry category of baked goods along with brioche, Danish and puff
      pastries.

      <br />

      Croissants are often stuffed with different sweet or savory fillings. The
      classic sweet-filled croissants use almonds, marzipan, or chocolate,
      whereas savory croissants might be filled variously with cheese, spinach,
      or ham.
