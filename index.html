    <h5>
      Croissants are French viennoiserie pastries that are actually from Austria
      (Vienna). They are made with a yeast leavened dough that has been
      laminated with butter, in multiple layers. A croissant is a laminated,
      yeast-leavened bakery product that contains dough/roll-in fat layers to
      create a flaky, crispy texture.

      <br />
      <br />
      They belong to the Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked goods along
      with brioche, Danish and puff pastries. Croissants are often stuffed with
      different sweet or savory fillings. The classic sweet-filled croissants
      use almonds, marzipan, or chocolate, whereas savory croissants might be
      filled variously with cheese, spinach, or ham.
